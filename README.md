# sinricpro-home-automation
This project demonstrates how to build a smart home automation system using an ESP8266 NodeMCU, Sinric Pro, and a 4-channel relay module to control LED bulbs or other household appliances from anywhere using voice commands or the Sinric Pro mobile app.  With this setup, you can connect up to four devices (e.g., LED bulbs, fans, or other low-power appliances) and control them over the internet using Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or the Sinric Pro app.  This project is beginner-friendly and designed to give you hands-on experience with IoT, cloud integration, and home automation concepts.
