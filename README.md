# üîå ESP8266 + Sinric Pro Smart Home Automation

![Project Banner](./images/project_cover.png)

> **Control Home Appliances & LEDs Remotely using ESP8266, Sinric Pro, and a 4-Channel Relay!**  
Seamlessly integrate Google Assistant & Alexa to build a **smart home ecosystem** with IoT.

---

## üìå Overview

This project demonstrates **home automation** using an **ESP8266 Wi-Fi module**, a **4-channel relay**, and **Sinric Pro** cloud integration.  
With this setup, you can **control LED bulbs, fans, or other devices** from anywhere using **voice commands** or the **Sinric Pro app**.

**Why Sinric Pro?**  
Unlike hardcoded Google APIs, Sinric Pro provides a **simple cloud interface** that connects your devices to **Alexa, Google Assistant, or custom apps**.
